# Connection Reliability and Debug Logging Fixes

## Summary of Issues Fixed

This commit addresses the connection reliability and debug logging toggle issues identified in the Xiaozhi MCP Home Assistant integration.

## Connection Reliability Fixes

### Issue 1: Connection Monitor Delay
**Problem**: The connection monitor loop waited 30 seconds before starting the first health check, causing delayed detection of connection issues.

**Fix**: Modified `_connection_monitor_loop()` in `coordinator.py` to perform an immediate first check, then wait for the configured interval for subsequent checks.

**Impact**: Connection failures are now detected immediately rather than after a 30-second delay.

### Issue 2: Connection Wait Logic
**Problem**: `async_wait_for_connection()` would return False immediately if `_connecting` was False, even if the connection might be established externally.

**Fix**: Modified the logic to continue waiting for the connection to be established regardless of the `_connecting` state, only timing out after the specified duration.

**Impact**: Manual connection attempts and external connection establishment now work reliably.

### Issue 3: Race Conditions in Reconnection
**Problem**: Multiple reconnection triggers could cause race conditions and inconsistent state management.

**Fix**: The existing cancellation logic in `async_reconnect()` already handled this properly. The main issues were in the monitor timing and wait logic.

## Debug Logging Toggle Fixes

### Issue 1: Logger Level Not Changed
**Problem**: The debug logging toggle only controlled specific debug messages but didn't actually change the logger levels for the integration.

**Fix**: 
- Added `_update_logger_level()` method to dynamically change logger levels for all xiaozhi_mcp loggers
- Added `_initialize_logger_levels()` method to set initial logger levels based on config
- Modified switch `async_turn_on()` and `async_turn_off()` to call logger level updates

**Impact**: The debug logging toggle now actually enables/disables DEBUG level logging for the entire integration.

### Issue 2: Toggle State Not Persisted
**Problem**: Debug logging toggle state was only stored in memory and not persisted to the configuration entry.

**Fix**: 
- Added `_persist_logging_state()` method to save the toggle state to the config entry
- Modified switch methods to persist state changes

**Impact**: Debug logging toggle state now survives Home Assistant restarts.

## Testing

### Connection Reliability Tests
All existing connection stability tests now pass:
- `test_connection_monitoring_detects_stale_connection` ✓
- `test_automatic_reconnection_on_failure` ✓  
- `test_wait_for_connection_success` ✓
- Plus 5 other related tests ✓

### Debug Logging Tests
Added comprehensive test coverage for debug logging functionality:
- `test_initial_state` ✓
- `test_turn_on_debug_logging` ✓
- `test_turn_off_debug_logging` ✓
- `test_logger_level_initialization` ✓
- `test_multiple_logger_initialization` ✓

## Files Modified

1. **`custom_components/xiaozhi_mcp/coordinator.py`**
   - Modified `_connection_monitor_loop()` for immediate first check
   - Modified `async_wait_for_connection()` to wait properly
   - Added `_initialize_logger_levels()` method
   - Added logger level initialization to `async_setup()`

2. **`custom_components/xiaozhi_mcp/switch.py`**
   - Added import for `CONF_ENABLE_LOGGING`
   - Modified `async_turn_on()` and `async_turn_off()` for debug logging
   - Added `_update_logger_level()` method
   - Added `_persist_logging_state()` method

3. **`tests/test_debug_logging.py`** (new file)
   - Comprehensive test coverage for debug logging functionality

## Minimal Changes Approach

The fixes were implemented with minimal code changes:
- Only 2 core files were modified
- Existing functionality preserved
- New methods added only where necessary
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No breaking changes to the API

## Verification

Both issues have been thoroughly tested and verified:
1. Connection reliability issues are resolved (all tests pass)
2. Debug logging toggle now works properly (logger levels change dynamically)
3. Toggle state is persisted across restarts
4. No regressions in existing functionality
